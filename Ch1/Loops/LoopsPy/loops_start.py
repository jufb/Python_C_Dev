# Python for the C# Developer by Joe Marini
# Example code file for loops

# the Python for loop always acts as an iterator - the typical
# (init value, test, increment) pattern isn't something you see in Python

# TODO: to iterate over a count, you create a numerical iterator with range()
for i in range(10):
    print(i, end=" ")
print("\n---------")


print("\n---------")

# TODO: iterating over a collection or string is the same as with C# foreach,
# but we use the same "for" keyword
thestr = "Hello World!"

print("\n---------")

# TODO: if you really need an index, you can use enumerate()

print("\n---------")


# TODO: Similarly, there's only a while loop in python and no do-while, which
# is just syntactic sugar for a loop that always executes at least once
